            <p class="text">Guru Purnima is a celebration of one’s spiritual leaders or teachers. The importance of Guru Purnima makes it an important day to pay reverence to our Gurus. It is believed that this day is observed to remove the darkness from our minds. Many sacred books and scriptures dictate the significance of gurus and the exemplary bond between a Guru and the disciple

            A Sanskrit saying goes stating that in a child’s life, the first place should be given to the mother, second to the father, third to the guru and fourth to the almighty. Gurus are given a much higher position in our culture; thus, Guru Purnima is celebrated on the full moon or Purnima of Asadha Month every year.
